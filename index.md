### Week 3, 20 January, 2015: Response to Galloway's *Love of the Middle*

What strikes me first is Galloway’s consistently negative portrayal of the swarm-mentality as a hateful, emergent animus. If we are discussion “contemporary media as . . . nodes in a network” (62), why not turn the furious force into something positive? A hive analogy is not far off; whether we go with a bee or with Deleuze and Guatari’s wasp, a drone may be an “impersonal agent. . . a counter [collector?] of entities” (62), part of a furious swarm, but isn’t the end result something more (the living system of the hive)? 

At any rate, to assume that exploring culture through the lens of the network makes the individual entities “impersonal” assumes that computers allow objective, value-free arguments, something Barad would contest. The kind of tools we use influence our meaning-making, but are still limited/biased appartuses. Additionally, Galloway writes as if “the machine” was an aggregate of non-agents; but Jane Bennett argues compellingly in Vibrant Matter for the idea of agentive things (person or inanimate) that make any network an unpredictable entity. Bennet uses the power grid as her example, citing a massive and unforeseen blackout caused by the unexpected interactions of nodes.
The fury of the swarm relies, Galloway says, on the “micro functions” of its parts (62); and somehow this “disseminating consciousness and causality” onto the numerous parts “threaten[s] the sanctity of the human” (63) (a problematic phrase if ever there was)? 

I suppose I ultimately take issue with Galloway’s assumption that being a node in a network automatically results in depersonalizing objectivity, as if reading with/through/alongside a computer was not one method of subjective literary thought. It may not be criticism in the traditional sense; but keeping in mind Barad’s value-laden apparatus, I don’t think the conclusions are necessarily more objective.

## Thought Piece

Recently I’m interested in the ways matter shows itself as an active force in our life, and the ways subjects are constituted by or participate in interactions with nonhuman (nonpersonal) actants/assemblages. Most recently I traced this concept in Medieval literature, especially Chaucer, contrasting an implied rebellious material agency to an explicit, personified, divinely ordered Nature.  The research question was ultimately whether the concept of agentive, often confounding matter (Hyle) persisted from early sources like Bernardus Sylvestris, even if it was not named. The question beyond the Medieval texts, however, was how to apply ideas of agentive matter a la Jane Bennett, recent and popular theorist of vibrant materialism.

I like Bennett's idea of recovering a sense of active matter, present in Medieval literature but fading even before Chaucer's time. I think new media, troubling familiar ways of thinking about scholarship, text, and the subjects of study, may help to bring to the forefront a new perspective. 

I’m fascinated by the idea of using a game as an extension of a critical argument. As a student of ecocriticism, the way games present the world in which they are set has always interested me. The environment is often experienced as either a resource or a limit—woods to be harvested, an unnavigable stand of trees that marks the end of the generated world. If not useable, it is ignored. 

Most (all?) games with a resource management component frame the environment and its components in a certain way—the isolated subject who can make use of and convert matter into tools for further harvesting/crafting/consumption. Can a game present a world in which matter is vibrant and participatory, used less as dull and passive stuff and more of a co-agent, something with which allies one’s game avatar in order to accomplish a certain end? That is, could a game highlight the way “human agency. . . [is] an interfolding network of humanity and nonhumanity” (Bennett 31).

Keeping in mind Barad’s discussion of apparatuses as arguments, the idea of critique as praxis, as doing what it’s discussing, seems to apply most obviously to games. I think games can be critical arguments, but producing a game-as-argument is not consumptive or secondary. Such criticism (of genre, of ontological and environmental thought) sidestepping one of the critiques Felski levels at scholarly efforts. 

As for the tools, my lack of knowledge in this area is vast, and any tools would need to be learned along the way. (The extent of my current knowledge is that relatively simple browser games can be made from HTML5.) Alternately, as a fallback/concession to the yawning void of my inexperience, presenting an argument in a way that could be “reconfigured by the reader,” as Posner describes Scalar, might be useful. Scalar or perhaps reactive text (active markdown) experimentation might be a more attainable goal. Such an approach could highlight the way different relations of parts create a different kind of whole, trouble the idea of the isolated and brilliant truth-producing scholar. As McCarty says with regard to models, "failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result" [Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies](http://digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-6-2&toc.id=0&brand=9781405148641_brand) Troubling the certainty or at least fixed nature of a project would enable it to enact in its form the idea that what we often see as coherent wholes are actually “agentive assemblages” (quote Bennett), that even our own projects are a confluence of forces of which we are a part.
