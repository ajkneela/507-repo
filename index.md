## Week 3, 20 January, 2015: Response to Galloway's *Love of the Middle*

What strikes me first is Galloway’s consistently negative portrayal of the swarm-mentality as a hateful, emergent animus. If we are discussion “contemporary media as . . . nodes in a network” (62), why not turn the furious force into something positive? A hive analogy is not far off; whether we go with a bee or with Deleuze and Guatari’s wasp, a drone may be an “impersonal agent. . . a counter [collector?] of entities” (62), part of a furious swarm, but isn’t the end result something more (the living system of the hive)? At any rate, to assume that exploring culture through the lens of the network makes the individual entities “impersonal” assumes that computers allow objective, value-free arguments, something Barad would contest. The kind of tools we use influence our meaning-making, but are still limited/biased appartuses. 
Additionally, Galloway writes as if “the machine” was an aggregate of non-agents; but Jane Bennett argues compellingly in Vibrant Matter for the idea of agentive things (person or inanimate) that make any network an unpredictable entity. Bennet uses the power grid as her example, citing a massive and unforeseen blackout caused by the unexpected interactions of nodes. The fury of the swarm relies, Galloway says, on the “micro functions” of its parts (62); and somehow this “disseminating consciousness and causality” onto the numerous parts “threaten[s] the sanctity of the human” (63) (a problematic phrase if ever there was)? 
I suppose I ultimately take issue with Galloway’s assumption that being a node in a network automatically results in depersonalizing objectivity, as if reading with/through/alongside a computer was not one method of subjective literary thought. It may not be criticism in the traditional sense; but keeping in mind Barad’s value-laden apparatus, I don’t think the conclusions are necessarily more objective.
