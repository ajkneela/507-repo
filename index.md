**Co-occurrence Network**
![preliminary co-occurrence network](networkproto.jpg)

**Using the Data**
I’m using a  co-occurrence network and selected close reading to argue that Mary Russell Mitford’s animal characters do not only serve as social links between characters of different classes but also participate in social relationships. Additionally, my preliminary topic model indicates that discussions of flora and fauna of the village often appear in clusters with affect. Both data sets support the claim that Mitford is socializing the landscape and trying to frame the rural village as a place where unique forms of relationship and affect can be experienced because of the interactions that are possible in that space.
The final product will likely not be discoverable but instead submitted via github, technically public but no doubt difficult to actually find. None of the data, therefore, will be discoverable publically, although they may be discussed in the body of the essay, as content and length allow.
 


## 3 March, 2015 Abstract 
**Homewords—Textual Landscapes and the Victorian Ecotone in Mary Russell Mitford’s Our Village**

In 1824 Mary Russell Mitford published a series of sketches of rural England collected under the title Our Village. The sketches were compared with Jane Austen’s novels in their meticulous attention to village social life. Mitford depicts the English village as a place where unique forms of affect can be cultivated within the social networks that form there. In Mitford’s rural British village she dwells within a social network that includes animals and even plants. The paper will explore to what degree nonhumans forge the links between the characters of Mitford’s sketches. In addition to close reading of several passages, visualizing the social networks of Mitford’s Three Mile Cross (perhaps using a force-directed graph) will help to place the work’s animals more clearly within those networks, answering the question of how often and to what extent relationships between humans from because of Mitford’s animal character, and whether animal characters influence relationships between humans of different social classes. Other questions such visualizations might answer include whether significant relationships form between humans and animals or between animals themselves. Can mapping Mitford’s many walks—destinations, noted pauses, encounters— reveal patterns that speak to the significance of village flora in relation to Mitford’s friendships? Finally, Topic modeling of the text of Our Village shows that animals, plants, characters, appear together throughout the work along with words related to nationality. How does Mitford connect her village, already a setting rife with nostalgic resonance when it was published in the 1820s, to a national identity?  

**Bonus: fun fact!**-- Currently, in Three Mile Cross, Mitford's Village, there is a dog swim therapy clinic off the main road. It is called '[Aquadoggies K9 Hydrotherapy Pool!](http://www.aquadoggies.com)'.

**Scope**- Mitford’s nonhuman inhabitants may occupy most of the essay, and the question of national identity, although significant, may exceed the scope of the project.

**Concerns** -- tool use. Too many tools? Will the visual elements add enough to the argument to make them worth using or are they simply confirming what I found with good old fashioned reading?

## 24 February, 2015
After some internal conflict, the limitations of aging hardware and personal inexperience convinced me to scrap my intended project (academically; casually, it's a question I intend to keep in mind). At this point, I'm thinking I'll return to at an essay I wrote during my M.A. on 19th century author Mary R. Mitford's *Our Village.* I wrote about how Mitford presents the rural English village as a chronotope in which unique social networks can form between persons of different classes and species, in which even the flowers have cultural and social significance. Initial efforts towards topic modeling have confirmed that animals, plants, characters, affect and nationality all appear in significantly related clusters (along with colors and relationship words-- e.g., "father" or "friend"). Force-directed visualizations of relationships would help see just how integrated animals are into Mitford's social network. The original intention for the project was a visual exploration of social networks. At the time I didn't have the tools, but [Protovis](http://mbostock.github.io/protovis/ex/force.html"Force-directed Layouts) has some code and examples of various visualizations, and RStudio, Voyant, and Mallet may also be helpful. Perhaps community recognition algorithms might be worth considering? Protovis's force-directed layouts (linked to above) would be ideal for seeing just how much weight and which connections each character really has. 
Additionally, mapping might be worth considering. How could visualized networks, topic modeling, and the locations of Mitford's Three Mile Cross be integrated? Is the use of visualization going to nuance my argument or simply reinforce my established findings? 

## 18 February, 2015 Annotated Bibliography

**Primary Sources**
As my project is essentially a prototype of a game, differing widely from the more navigable (and perhaps more academically rigorous) work of digital text/visual analysis, I have no "primary sources" per se.

Primary Claim: You play as a group; most action is prompted but takes place without your guidance—no “mastery” over gameplay. 
Relevance: Models one way to downplay the subject position of the player, does away with any idea of “mastery,” is still recognizably an entertaining game without centralizing the player.

Primary Claim: Posits a flat ontology which necessitates speculative thought and a position of wonder. 
Relevance: Bogost’s exploration of difference, specifically as it relates to being thinkers-as-gamemakers, is a nice corollary to Bennet’s vibrant materialism. 
--Persuasive Games
Primary Claim: Games can construct a process to make an argument—procedural rhetoric. “Rules of execution” are potentially expressive and persuasive.
Relevant: Bogost explores exactly how games argue in different context with a great deal of specific games as examples.

Primary Claim: player’s character changes based on consumption of surroundings, calling into question who or what the player is. 
Relevance: While not especially dramatic, the destabilization of the form the player takes/inhabits is of interest to a project hoping to reframe the subject-environment relationship.

##4 February, 2015, Edited Thought Pieces
Recently I’m interested in the ways matter shows itself as an active force and the ways subjects are constituted by or participate in interactions with nonhuman/nonpersonal actants or assemblages. Most recently I traced this concept in Medieval literature, especially Chaucer. More interesting than the Medieval texts, at least to me, was how to apply ideas of agentive matter a la Jane Bennett, recent and popular theorist of vibrant materialism.
I like Bennett's idea of recovering a sense of active matter, present in Medieval literature but fading even before Chaucer's time. I think games offer a unique way of representing/exploring relationships between subject and environment.  As a student of ecocriticism, the way games present the world in which they are set has always interested me. The environment is often experienced as either a resource or a limit—wood to be harvested, an unnavigable stand of trees that marks the end of the generated world. If not useable, it is ignored. 

Most (all?) games with a resource management component frame the environment and its components in a certain way—the isolated player or subject who can make use of and convert matter into tools for further harvesting/crafting/consumption. Can a game present a world in which matter is vibrant and participatory, used less as dull and passive stuff and more of a co-agent, something with which allies one’s game avatar in order to accomplish a certain end? That is, could a game highlight the way “human agency. . . [is] an interfolding network of humanity and nonhumanity” (Bennett 31).

Keeping in mind Barad’s discussion of apparatuses as arguments, then,  the idea of critique as praxis, seems to apply most obviously to games. I think games can be critical arguments in the way they frame the subject-environment relationship; yet a game-as-argument is not consumptive or secondary. Such criticism (of genre, of ontological and environmental thought) sidesteps one of the critiques Felski levels at scholarly work. 

The crux of the process now is whether to attempt a very simple game or to instead produce a prototype. The concept of the physics engine seems to be the most relevant point of entry when considering how games frame matter/the environment. This makes a hack or a mod less relevant, and designing an engine is *far* beyond the scope of both my abilities and the project. (The extent of my current knowledge is that relatively simple browser games can be made from HTML5), perhaps suggesting that a prototype (paper prototype?) might be most relevant. Further reading (Bogost, Alex Galloway, perhaps Anna Anthropy) is required/ongoing.

 Regardless, approaching the idea of vibrant matter using games can, I think, highlight the way different relations of parts create a different kind of whole, trouble the idea of the isolated subject. Whatever the final form, I want to explore elements of co-native bodies, the "death of the player," the idea of a game in which you are not always in control or even certain of what you are. As McCarty says with regard to models, "failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result" [Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies](http://digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-6-2&toc.id=0&brand=9781405148641_brand). Troubling the certainty or at least fixed nature of the subject or game-character would enable a game to enact in its form the idea that what we often see as coherent wholes are actually “agentive assemblages” (quote Bennett).

## 27 January, 2015, Thought Piece and Reviews

**Danielle Morgan**
The idea for an "open" edition of Wilde's adaptation of the Nightengale's fairy tale is promising. Reasonable in scope, it could address the different levels of accessibility inherent in fable-tales, and play with the idea of irony as it addresses transmission, mediatian, and response. 
The idea, too, that reader response to Danielle's presentation of a Wilde tale would consist of productive interpretation--namely, illustrative annotation-- is perhaps it's most intriguing aspect. Wilde's adaptation would visibly accrue new meaning as reader-artists added their interpretations. The way  readers approached Wilde's work and Danielle's illustrations would change as others were added. Different audiences would be addressed with each illustration.
Other ideas to consider would be in what form to present the text of the story--typography and digital paratext could offer other modes of interpretation and presentation. Other ideas offered included sound components--audio annotations, with passages read by contributors vocally interpreting the text. 
As promising as the Wilde project is, the alternate project concerning *The Sisters Brothers* is intriguing as well. DeWitt's novel has not received a great deal of attention, being relatively new; and the novel itself occupies an odd generic position, situated so closely to the border between film and novel. (The film rights were bought even before the novel was published, if I'm not mistaken, and DeWitt produced a "trailer" of the novel before its release.) Regardless, both projects seem to have promise, not only because of their subject matter but because their scope is managable even within the context of complex projects

**Katherine [whose last name I unfortunately forgot--sorry!]**
Impressive in its political engagement, Katharine's works has many potential forms in which to manifest: Deformance of Thomas King's *The Inconvenient Indian*, a more traditional essay with a polling component, an interactive timeline of settler-indigenous relations, or even a game that makes the player unwittingly enact the devastating land-grabs and displacement of North American settlement. The biggest challenge is, perhaps, discovering/deciding what is most feasible and most applicable to the essay from which the project will grow. However, each project offers a chance to explore the integral idea of irony and context, as each idea plays with the idea of withholding information from the reader/player and then making them reevaluate their past opinions/actions/understanding. 
Other components discussed mainly addressed potential ways that viewing results of polls, deformations, or games could provide insight into further research. This idea seems to be the most tricky; outside of a poll, viewing the ways the audience might react to whatever form Katherine's essay takes might require simply *being* there when they experience it or asking them to save and submit the final result (as with the interactive/quiz-like timeline). Overall, it promises to be an interesting and important project addressing unseen/systemic racism. 

**Ashley Burr**
Ahsley's proposed project on the Earl of Rochester's pseudo-confessional poem offers a good testing ground, a short amount of text with which to experiment. Proposed work includes deformation, perhaps with an element of reader choice, focusing on the pronouns and the religious elements of the Earl's "To the Postboy." Replacing aspects of the poem (either religious or libertine) with their opposites might provide a different perspective. 
Other ideas included offering two different types of presentation,a  "heavenly" or "hellish" reading, which would display the poem with different paratextual designs, casting the poem in different lights, and only afterword offering a view of the poem in a more neutral way. This presentation would require some basic design, but ultimately could be done even with something as simple as a Wordpress blog. 
Including selected biographical information in annotations might be another way to offer certain intended readings of the poem. 
The idea is intriguing because Ashley's original project, the inspiration for this proposed work, was sparked by a seemingly inconsistent religious strain that casts a new light on rumors of a deathbed conversion to Christianity. These experiments with presentation and deformation engage with the tension between author and work, the way each informs the other, and the uncertainty inherent in reading work biographically. 

**Thoughtpiece**

Recently I’m interested in the ways matter shows itself as an active force in our life, and the ways subjects are constituted by or participate in interactions with nonhuman (nonpersonal) actants/assemblages. Most recently I traced this concept in Medieval literature, especially Chaucer, contrasting an implied rebellious material agency to an explicit, personified, divinely ordered Nature.  The research question was ultimately whether the concept of agentive, often confounding matter (Hyle) persisted from early sources like Bernardus Sylvestris, even if it was not named. The question beyond the Medieval texts, however, was how to apply ideas of agentive matter a la Jane Bennett, recent and popular theorist of vibrant materialism.

I like Bennett's idea of recovering a sense of active matter, present in Medieval literature but fading even before Chaucer's time. I think new media, troubling familiar ways of thinking about scholarship, text, and the subjects of study, may help to bring to the forefront a new perspective. 

I’m fascinated by the idea of using a game as an extension of a critical argument. As a student of ecocriticism, the way games present the world in which they are set has always interested me. The environment is often experienced as either a resource or a limit—woods to be harvested, an unnavigable stand of trees that marks the end of the generated world. If not useable, it is ignored. 

Most (all?) games with a resource management component frame the environment and its components in a certain way—the isolated subject who can make use of and convert matter into tools for further harvesting/crafting/consumption. Can a game present a world in which matter is vibrant and participatory, used less as dull and passive stuff and more of a co-agent, something with which allies one’s game avatar in order to accomplish a certain end? That is, could a game highlight the way “human agency. . . [is] an interfolding network of humanity and nonhumanity” (Bennett 31).

Keeping in mind Barad’s discussion of apparatuses as arguments, the idea of critique as praxis, as doing what it’s discussing, seems to apply most obviously to games. I think games can be critical arguments, but producing a game-as-argument is not consumptive or secondary. Such criticism (of genre, of ontological and environmental thought) sidestepping one of the critiques Felski levels at scholarly efforts. 

As for the tools, my lack of knowledge in this area is vast, and any tools would need to be learned along the way. (The extent of my current knowledge is that relatively simple browser games can be made from HTML5.) Alternately, as a fallback/concession to the yawning void of my inexperience, presenting an argument in a way that could be “reconfigured by the reader,” as Posner describes Scalar, might be useful. Scalar or perhaps reactive text (active markdown) experimentation might be a more attainable goal. Such an approach could highlight the way different relations of parts create a different kind of whole, trouble the idea of the isolated and brilliant truth-producing scholar. As McCarty says with regard to models, "failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result" [Knowing: Modeling in Literary Studies](http://digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-6-2&toc.id=0&brand=9781405148641_brand) Troubling the certainty or at least fixed nature of a project would enable it to enact in its form the idea that what we often see as coherent wholes are actually “agentive assemblages” (quote Bennett), that even our own projects are a confluence of forces of which we are a part.

## 20 January, 2015: Response to Galloway's *Love of the Middle*

What strikes me first is Galloway’s consistently negative portrayal of the swarm-mentality as a hateful, emergent animus. If we are discussion “contemporary media as . . . nodes in a network” (62), why not turn the furious force into something positive? A hive analogy is not far off; whether we go with a bee or with Deleuze and Guatari’s wasp, a drone may be an “impersonal agent. . . a counter [collector?] of entities” (62), part of a furious swarm, but isn’t the end result something more (the living system of the hive)? 

At any rate, to assume that exploring culture through the lens of the network makes the individual entities “impersonal” assumes that computers allow objective, value-free arguments, something Barad would contest. The kind of tools we use influence our meaning-making, but are still limited/biased appartuses. Additionally, Galloway writes as if “the machine” was an aggregate of non-agents; but Jane Bennett argues compellingly in Vibrant Matter for the idea of agentive things (person or inanimate) that make any network an unpredictable entity. Bennet uses the power grid as her example, citing a massive and unforeseen blackout caused by the unexpected interactions of nodes.
The fury of the swarm relies, Galloway says, on the “micro functions” of its parts (62); and somehow this “disseminating consciousness and causality” onto the numerous parts “threaten[s] the sanctity of the human” (63) (a problematic phrase if ever there was)? 

I suppose I ultimately take issue with Galloway’s assumption that being a node in a network automatically results in depersonalizing objectivity, as if reading with/through/alongside a computer was not one method of subjective literary thought. It may not be criticism in the traditional sense; but keeping in mind Barad’s value-laden apparatus, I don’t think the conclusions are necessarily more objective.
